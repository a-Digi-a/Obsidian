# Numbers

## Integers

Integers are **whole numbers**, and can be both positive or negative.
```python
x = 1
y = 734566222155
z = -23425565
```

You can cast to an integer using:
```python
x = int(x)
```
## Floats

Floats are numbers which **contain decimals**, and can be positive or negative
```python
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -73.24
```

Floats can also contain scientific numbers, *e* for example means to the power of 10:
```python
x = 53e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100
```

You can cast to a float using:
```python
x = float(x)
```

## Complex

Complex numbers are written with a *j* as the imaginary part:
```python
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j
```

You can cast to a complex using:
```python
x = complex(x)
```

# Strings

Strings in python are surrounded by either single or double quotes:
```python
x = "hi"
y = 'hello'
```

You can use quotes inside of a strin
