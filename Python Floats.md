# Floats

Floats are numbers which **contain decimals**, and can be positive or negative
```python
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -73.24
```

Floats can also contain scientific numbers, *e* for example means to the power of 10:
```python
x = 53e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100
```

You can cast to a float using:
```python
x = float(x)
```
