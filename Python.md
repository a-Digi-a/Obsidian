## What is python?

Python is a [[high-level]] **general purpose** programming language. It is an interpreted programming language, meaning that the python script can be run through a program called an [[interpreter]] without having to be [[compiler|compiled]] into machine code like you would have to with [[C]] or [[Rust]].

Python is also an [[object-oriented]] programming language. It organizes data based on **objects** which contain data and uses functions to manipulate the data.
