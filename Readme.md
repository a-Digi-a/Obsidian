# Digi's Notes!

These notes are designed for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## Installation

- After you've installed obsidian, download the notes by clicking the **green code button** in the top right, then downloading as zip.
- Extract the zip file, then open the folder in obsidian
## How to Use

- All of the notes have **tags**, which you can search through on the left
- Use **control + O** to search for file names, such as **Python**
- If you cant find a file for a concept, try using **Control + Shift + S**, this searches for words in files!
- Use **control + P** to open the command palette, which lets you search for things like **insert table**, **insert code block** and more!

# Further Usage
- The notes are written in **markdown**, which you may be familiar with. 
- Use **hashtags** followed by a space for headings: "# Heading"
- Multiple hashtags can be used for smaller/sub headings
- Use **hashtags with no space** to put a tag on a note: \#tag!
- Surround a note in **square brackets** to link to it: "\[[note]]"
- Surround a word with **asterisks** to italicize it: "\*word\*"
- Surround a word with **two asterisks** to make it bold: "\*\*word\*\*"
- You can search up other intricacies on your own, this is what I mostly use!
